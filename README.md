# MRC_ASL_CiC

A post-processing pipeline for arterial spin labelling (ASL) MRI images in the ASL Confidence in Concept (CiC) project funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC)

## Overview

The ASL_CiC project aims to provide more confidence in the clinical use of arterial spin labelling in cerebral perfusion measurements. Specifically, it delineates a post-processing pipeline that achieves the following:

- reliable and repeatable individual CBF measurements
- detectable individual changes in CBF


## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are specific to the pipeline:

## Future work

- Incoporate personalised perfusion reference
